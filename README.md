First sort the data into the following directory format:- 
Main Folder:
  Sub Folder 1:
    Replay_x.json
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
  Sub Folder 2:
    Replay_y.json
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  .
  and sub folders, whose name is class name are created in the given format.
  Make sure to change the input_path and output_path in the main function for it to work properly!!
  Also before running the program upload the above directory formatted folder to your drive.
  For an Example directory format, you can follow the uploaded "data before classification" folder for a better understanding of the way the replay files need to be sorted before parsing with the program.
